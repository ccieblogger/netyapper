# Developer Log for Workstream 1 (Issue #114)

## 2025-05-12

- Set issue #114 to 'In progress' and logged all major steps in the GitHub issue comments.
- Proposed and executed a 5-phase plan:
  1. Project structure validation and migration from `api/` to `app/`.
  2. Added `pyproject.toml` with Poetry and all required dependencies.
  3. Created `docker-compose.dev.yml` for FastAPI, PostgreSQL, and optional Ollama.
  4. Validated CLI entry at `cli/query.py` (Click-based, functional, no changes needed).
  5. Updated `README.md` for Poetry, Docker Compose, CLI, and directory structure.
- Cleaned up Python bytecode cache directories from source folders.
- Committed all changes in two commits (scaffold + legacy cleanup).
- No obsolete or temporary files found in tracked source.

All changes are now committed and the workspace is clean.
